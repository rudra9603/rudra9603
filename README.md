👋 Hello, I'm Rudra kumar!!!

🚀 My Journey:

I've been on a coding adventure for 7 years since school, and during this time,
 I've had the privilege of working on a variety of projects and interesting questions.
 These experiences have allowed me to develop my skills in C , C++ , PYTHON and JAVA.
Java was part of my syllabus from 6th class i continued solving different kinds of mathematical and different algorithms questions, then i learned
new languages and made projects such as 'LOGIN AND REGISTRATION SYSTEM','Hand cricket game'.

💡 Development Philosophy:

I'm a firm believer in open-source software and collaborative coding. I enjoy solving complex problems and working in teams to build elegant solutions. My coding philosophy is to write clean, efficient, and well-documented code that not only solves immediate problems but can also serve as a learning resource for others.

🌱 What's Next:

I'm constantly learning and exploring new horizons in the world of technology. My current interests include Data Science , Machine learning.I'm excited to connect with fellow developers, collaborate on interesting projects, and learn from each other.
